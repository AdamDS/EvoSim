The above numbers represent save options and runtime options according to the following:

	0 = save & 1 = don't save

p = population (how many indivs in each generation)

c = coordinate phenotype (indivs phenotype coords)

a = parent(s) (indiv's parent(s)...dependent on speciation type)

n = neighbor(s) (indiv's neighbor(s)...dependent on speciation type)

m = mutability (indiv's mutability)

g = genus (how many species in each generation)

z = species size (how many in each species, centroid coords, and density)

C = species centroid coodinate

d = species density

o = indivs in species (indiv identities)

f = fitness landscape

k = shifted landscape


t = NGEN
	0 = default - 1000 generations
	1 = customize number of generations to run

i = IPOP
	0 = default - 300 starting population
	1 = customize number of initial indivs

e = experiment type
	0 = single mutability
	1 = competition

s = speciation type 
	0 = default - Nate's
	1 = Adam's

h = hereditary type
	0 = default - assortative mating
	1 = cloning
r = landscape movement
	0 = default - move every 2 generations
	1 = customize rate

v = landscape variation
	if = 0, default - the landscape will vary between 1 and 4
	if = 1, customize the landscape low and high fitness values


NOTE:
Nate's speciation is based on the two nearest neighbors (reproduction isolation + next nearest).  Mating occurs between nearest neighbor only.

Adam's speciation is based soley on the nearest neighbor (reproduction isolation).  Mating occurs between nearest neighbor only.
